nothing against unabashedly romantic films . \\nwhen done right , with at least slightly evident restraint , they can be engaging , sweeping , appealing . \\nbut it\\'s a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle , a hollow , boring romance that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers ; the ones willing to buy into ephron\\'s whiny views of life and romance . \\ntom hanks and meg ryan , two of hollywood\\'s most likeable stars play sam baldwin and annie reed , repectively . \\nbaldwin\\'s wife recently died and he moved to seattle with his son , jonah , seeking to get away from the familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse . \\njonah senses tension and calls a talk radio show to tell the world about their problems . \\nsam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show , but when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out . \\nephron has him do this so that annie reed ( meg ryan ) can hear it . \\nannie is a happy woman . \\nshe is engaged to walter , an allergy-prone working man and seems to be perfectly content . \\nbut after hearing sam the widower on the radio show , she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is willing to risk her engagement for it . \\nfive years after this movie hit theaters , hanks , ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better , although still sub-par romantic comedy you\\'ve got mail , which is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet . \\nat least that movie had a sense of spontaneity . \\nhere it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up for the last five . \\nthe fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory . \\nsleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers ; from its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman and rosie o\\'donnell . \\nbut none of them can save the film from being a bore . \\nits characters are dull and empty , its script isn\\'t funny or particularly charming . \\nthe script has a fundamental problem : annie gives up , for little reason , her life with walter to pursue \" sleepless in seattle , \" whom she has never even seen . \\nit\\'s the kind of life decision that real people don\\'t make , and its a major , unforgivable plausibility sacrifice . \\nin essence , this movie\\'s purpose is to head towards a goal that shouldn\\'t even exist . \\nit\\'s a ten minute short film with ninety-five minutes of filler . \\nif you were to show me sleepless in seattle and i didn\\'t have to review it , you could just call me \" asleep in philadelphia . \" \\n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;', '\" pokemon 3 : the movie \" has a lot of bad things in

especially the spritely carol ( boorem ) . \\nthen one day , a new boarder arrives at bobby\\'s house . \\nted brautigan ( hopkins ) is an enigmatic man to whom bobby takes an immediate liking . \\nas the bond between bobby and ted deepens , bobby becomes privy to ted\\'s great secret , an event which will change both of their lives forever . \\nreview : a small but enchanting movie , \" hearts in atlantis \" easily recalls another king-inspired coming-of-age film , \" stand by me \" , both in terms of its setting and the sentiment it conveys . \\n \" hearts \" is a tribute to the magic of childhood , to those summers when the days seem neverending , and nothing means more than your closest friends . \\nunlike \" stand by me \" , there is a supernatural element to \" hearts \" , but although it is key to the plot , it is not prominent . \\nlike \" stand by me \" , this is a mostly character-driven film , and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting . \\nyelchin is very good as bobby , finding a good mix of innocence and resignation . \\nmore splendid still is boorem , whom i praised highly for her work in \" along came a spider \" and who is simply radiant here as carol . \\nand then there is hopkins , who despite playing such a quiet , introspective character as ted , nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen . \\nless successful is davis , whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish . \\ni also found it odd that bobby and carol\\'s other friend , sully ( whose death as an adult sets up the movie\\'s flashback framing device ) , is paid virtually no attention . \\nbut hicks\\' direction is lovely without being cloying , and despite the movie\\'s general lack of incident , it never ceases to weave its spell over the audience .', \"with his last two films - shine and snow falling on cedars - australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there , and his latest , hearts in atlantis , is no different . \\nits structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle - is similar to the green mile , which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books . \\nthe parallels don't end there , either . \\natlantis was adapted by william goldman , who had previously penned the big-screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king's dreamcatcher . \\neven the film's content is a bit reminiscent of mile . \\nin fact , it's the perfect blend of the feel-good '60s nostalgia of stand by me ( also by king ) and mystical power hokum of mile . \\nking's atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories , but the main focus here is on the first ( and longest ) tale , called low men in yellow coats ( the film's title comes from the second chapter ) . \\nit's set in 1960 harwich , connecticut , where 11-year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house run by his cold , self-centered mother elizabeth ( hope davis , joe gould's secret ) , who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son . \\nbobby spends his time with his two closest friends , john sullivan ( will rothhaar ) and tomboy carol gerber ( mika boorem ) , who become something like the kevin , paul and winnie of harwich . \\nwhen a new tenant moves into the vacant room , the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins , hannibal ) , a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby's mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror . \\nted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature ( after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday ) , dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men , a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers . \\ni won't go into what these powers are , but they're considerably toned down from the book ( and don't involve black stuff flying out of ted's mouth , a la mile ) . \\natlantis' present-day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel's final chapter , titled heavenly shades of night are falling , and features david morse ( in yet another connection to the green mile ) as a married , middle-aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years . \\natlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks' cedars , which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski , the oscar-nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski's red . \\nthe acting is solid from everyone , including hopkins , who never once makes you think of dr . lecter . \\nmost impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem , who both had tiny parts in along came a spider . \\nwhile i didn't really have much of a problem with goldman's screenplay , i do need to point out at least one inconsistency . \\ngoldman , for those of you who don't read premiere , writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else's films , carefully explaining why they all suck , make no sense and insult their audiences , while somehow failing to mention the crap that he's penned ( like the general's daughter ) . \\nit's mean-spirited but fun to read , mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business ( including michael jackson , o . j . \\nand robert blake ) . \\nin atlantis , which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby , one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back . \\nwell , he's not , and it doesn't make sense . \\n1 : 41 - pg-13 for violence and thematic elements\", \"of the major horror sub-genres , vampire movies are easily the most adaptable . \\nthink about it . \\nfrankenstein movies haven't changed all that much because they still need that mad-scientist-in-bavarian-castle setting . \\nif you made a frankenstein movie today , you'd have to have the monster be a virus or something -- and outside of michael j . fox , there aren't any actors that could play a virus convincingly . \\nmovies about mummies would still have to be set in egypt . \\nthere's not much you can do with werewolves except take them to london or paris , unless you want to have a teenage werewolf or something . \\n ( and there's that michael j . fox thing again . ) \\nbut you can have vampires do anything , and you can place them in any genre you want , just about . \\nyou can have traditional vampire movies ( bram stoker's dracula ) or have the anne rice version ( interview with the vampire ) , or play it for laughs ( vampire in brooklyn ) . \\nyou can put vampires in locales from sunny southern california ( the lost boys ) to squalid mexican dives ( from dusk till dawn ) to your local high school ( buffy , the vampire slayer ) . \\nwere it not redundant , you could have a movie about a law firm full of vampires . \\nany day now , i expect we'll see a movie about a vampire third baseman who has to decide whether to play a day game in order to break the home run record . \\nor , you can insert the vampire legend into a hong kong action movie -- and when you do that , you get blade . \\nwesley snipes has the chow yun fat role in this movie -- the silent , expressionless hit man who destroys everything in his path . \\nin this case , the everything happens to be vampires that explode into cgi shards instead of dead , bleeding corpses . \\nsnipes has less to say here than as the fugitive in u . s . marshals , but does a demonstrably better job here as a half-vampire wreaking vengeance on the bloodsuckers . \\nblade is a silent , brooding presence , laying waste to vampires without a shred of remorse . \\nhe is as cold as his silver-bladed sword , as single minded as his garlic-filled bullets . \\nyet , he's not without quirks : blade drives a battered muscle car and has to glean rolex watches from his vampire victims in order to stay solvent . \\nlike any good hong kong movie , blade is heavy on the chopsocky action . \\nfor some reason , blade spends a lot more time using his kung fu artistry than using the traditional anti-vampire weapons of garlic and silver . \\n ( blade dismisses a man-portable arc lamp as being too heavy , although it looks to be a more efficient tool to dispatch vampires . ) \\nunfortunately , the guiding hand of john woo is absent from this film , relegating blade to the status of the replacement killers , which it most strongly resembles . \\nthe replacement killers is the last movie i saw that i didn't review -- mostly because it made no impression on me , and i couldn't remember anything other than noise , violence , and the intensity of fat's performance . \\nblade has a little more going for it , and has the vampire myth to draw from -- but other than that , it's the same kind of movie -- exciting , with well choreographed action scenes , but with no resonance . \\nwith a stronger villain ( stephen dorff is ( pardon the pun ) curiously bloodless as the head vampire , leaving us to wonder what denis leary might have done with the role ) , a wittier script , and a strong supporting cast , blade might have been able to rise beyond the level of commonplace summer entertainment . \\nas it is , blade is an average action movie that serves to do nothing but remind us that the summer movies just keep getting dumber and the vampire movies just keep multiplying .\", 'adam sandler isn\\'t known for appearing in deep , thought-provoking films , but he\\'s still a really funny guy . \\nmost of his movies are successful not because of the film making behind them , but because they let sandler do what he does best without a stupid plot to drown him out . \\nbig daddy is the first film in which the story seems more important than sandler\\'s comic performance , and it\\'s a miserable failure . \\nsandler plays a thirty-something loser who gets attached to an orphaned young boy ( played by cole and dylan sprouse ) . \\nas one might expect from the synopsis , director dennis dugan resorts to the usual bag of manipulative and sentimental sequences , including a repulsive courtroom battle and a lot of teary scenes in which characters say \" good-bye \" to one another ; in addition , there\\'s a ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet humor ( urine and vomit both get more screen time than sandler himself ) . \\nthere\\'s a hilarious running joke featuring a female doctor who previously worked at hooters , and the film features passable performances from sandler , joey lauren adams ( as the love interest ) , and the two young boys , but the film on the whole is trite and disappointingly unfunny .', 'susan granger\\'s review of \" songcatcher \" in the midst of this summer\\'s fare of dinos revisited and romantic

a lot of flying going on in this film ! \\nas our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in . \\nwell apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released . \\npart of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $110 , 000 in its original month of release ) . \\nsubsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved ) . \\nto celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high . \\nin an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us . \\nafter the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters . \\nis the format effective for the film ? \\nwith a few exceptions , yes . \\nthe first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven\\'s fifth symphony . \\nit\\'s hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily . \\neverything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts . \\neventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things . \\nthough this segment isn\\'t very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies . \\nthe next segment is set to ottorino respighi\\'s \" the pines of rome \" . \\nin this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape . \\na whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack . \\nhe is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the \" oceans \" of clouds . \\nagain , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved . \\nreportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size . \\nthe cgi whales look incredibly life-like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images . \\none especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent . \\nabsolutely beautiful stuff . \\nthe third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin\\'s \" rhapsody in blue \" . \\nthis segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york . \\nthere\\'s a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out-of-work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife . \\ni won\\'t go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending . \\nunfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments . \\nsegment four is set to dmitri shostakovich\\'s \" piano concerto no . 2 \" and is an animated version of hans christian andersen\\'s \" the steadfast tin soldier \" . \\na one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind-up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can\\'t see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack-in-the-box jester . \\nthe jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina . \\nlittle does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from . \\nthe soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl . \\nalthough the ending has been altered from the andersen story , \" the steadfast tin soldier \" is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short . \\nsome children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made . \\nsegment five is the funniest of the bunch . \\nset to camille saint-saens \" the carnival of the animals \" , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo-yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number . \\nwhile it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy . \\nsegment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia , and it\\'s the one that people remember most , \" the sorcerer\\'s apprentice \" . \\nthe story is the most recognizable , so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo . \\nunfortunately , the segment wasn\\'t made to be presented on large format film ( considering it was shot full frame ) and exhibits large amounts of grain . \\nthere were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain . \\nsimilar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately ( but no one seems to notice for some strange reason ) , an anomaly common to many 18-plus screen theaters . \\nsegment seven is set to sir edward elgar\\'s \" pomp and circumstance march no . 1 \" and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character . \\ndonald duck \" stars \" as an assistant to noah , whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark . \\nduring the loading , donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn\\'t make it on the boat . \\nthey are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners . \\ndespite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece , it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear-jerkers foisted on audiences these days . \\npowerful stuff . \\nsegment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich ? \" saving the best for last \" . \\nset to igor stravinsky\\'s \" the firebird \" , an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape . \\ntrees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation . \\nwhen the sprite examines the formation , it awakens and becomes the titular firebird . \\nin a stunning spectacle , the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path , including everything that the sprite has worked to create . \\nsome amazing animation is present here , and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone ( although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film ) . \\nthe host segments are largely ( no pun intended ) throwaways , although steve martin\\'s clip is pretty funny . \\nbe sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin . \\npenn and teller are usually funny , but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting . \\nthe best segment comes from , of all people , bette midler , who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board . \\npieces like flight of the bumblebee , a take on the four horsemen set to wagner\\'s \" ride of the valkyries \" , and a strange segment prepared in the \\'40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments . \\nfor fans of visual stimulation or classical music , fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon . \\nthe film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material . \\nas i mentioned earlier in the review , if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film , fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters . \\ni must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though . \\nthen you too can believe that whales/triangle things/sprites can fly . \\n[g]', 'i have no real tangible proof of this , but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script , written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director , then it is actually possible to make a good movie . \\nusing their logic , all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super-famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget . \\nthis is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time ( not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre ) . \\nnow , before i continue to ferociously attack what\\'s wrong with this film , i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller . \\ncatherine zeta-jones plays virginia baker , an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal ( sean connery ) . \\nif you\\'ve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before , i really don\\'t have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details : the two team up for various jobs , stealing various things for various purposes . \\nthe problem we come to is that we\\'ve all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesn\\'t break any new ground in the big-budget/hollywood/action genre . \\nthe result is that the entire production feels contrived . \\ni\\'m going to be completely honest here : pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run-time was looking at catherine zeta-jones . \\nnow while this may be a compliment for ms . zeta-jones , it certainly isn\\'t for either the writers or the director , who are not nearly as clever as they think they are . \\njust about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between \" entrapment \" and \" blackmail \" . \\nwith an eighty million dollar budget , you\\'d think that entrapment would at least feature edge-of-your seat action scenes or breathtaking special f/x . \\nwell , you\\'d be wrong . \\nthe action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular . \\nunfortunately for all those involved with entrapment , die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by ? 11 years . \\nthe reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture , you know exactly what\\'s going to happen , despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists . \\nmany scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zeta-jones in extremely tight-fitting clothing . \\none particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser-beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask . \\nnothing wrong with that , but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was - so why didn\\'t she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room ? \\ni\\'ll tell you why : because it\\'s a great excuse to photograph zeta-jones\\' posterior as it slides underneath those beams ( and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing - the rehearsal ) . \\nving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie , and though he has great screen presence ( although so do connery and zeta-jones ) and the most interesting character in the film , not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss ( a concept i invented just to describe this picture ) . \\none last complaint : entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building , or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot , he\\'ll spontaneously disappear in ninja-like fashion . \\ni can picture amiel patting himself on the back , thinking to himself \" it\\'ll leave the audience wondering for days : how did he do that ? \" \\nwe know jon , it\\'s called editing .', 'plot : a separated , glamorous , hollywood couple must pretend to reunite for a press junket of the last movie that they ever shot together . \\nkewl . . . now \\ni only wish that i could pretend never to have seen this movie . . . \\ncritique : trite , unfunny , boring and a waste of everyone\\'s talent . \\nhow a premise with such zest and bite can turn into a movie that doesn\\'t feature any chemistry , any real laughs , any surprises or any spice is beyond me . \\nhow julia roberts is used solely as a \" puppy dog \" character , puttering around in the background while we endure the complete bitchiness of zeta-jones\\' character , who is not one bit funny or romantic ( two ideal ingredients in a \" romantic comedy \" ) , is also beyond me . \\nand why they chose john cusack , a great , quirky actor in his own right , to play the most bland , uninteresting and unfetching character ( with zero chemistry with either of his leads ) is further more , beyond me . \\nand to anybody who decided that this project was \" funny \" enough to greenlight featuring the talents mentioned above , along with billy crystal , christopher walker , seth green and stanley tucci . . . well , \\nwhat can i say . . . i \\njust don\\'t have the words . \\nso is this the worst movie that i\\'ve seen all year ? \\nno . but it definitely sucks and it\\'s basically because . . . well , \\nit\\'s just not funny . \\nand for the record , allow me to state a few more problems with it . \\nit starts off slow , it\\'s got no energy , it doesn\\'t engage you with any of its characters ( julia barely gets somewhat interesting in the film , everyone else . . . lame ! ) , it utilizes way too many flashbacks to move the story forward , it\\'s utterly predictable , standard , routine , see-through and uninteresting as a plot and it just sits there on the screen , big and ugly , waiting . . . waiting for you to laugh or find something in it that is amusing . \\nand then hank azaria shows up . . . aaaaaah , the film\\'s savior ( mind you , some might be offended by his exaggeration of a stereotype , but that\\'s another story altogether ) . \\nbut when an experienced \" voice \" actor upstages all of the main stars in a summer \" blockbuster \" romantic comedy with an over-the-top antonio banderas accent , damn dude . . . your \\nfilm\\'s in trouble ! ! \\nrent this movie on video just to see what went wrong yourself . \\nthe references to ricky ricardo and senor wences ( huh ! ? ) , the idio-plot points like when one of the characters goes on the roof to stretch his arms out and relax , but everyone believes that he\\'s going to kill himself ( hardy-har-har ) and the cheap way of getting the audience to leave the theater laughing by bringing back a ball-sniffing dog that has no place being in the location at the end of the movie , well . . . i \\ncould go on . \\nbut i won\\'t because i do still respect all of the actors in this film and actually did laugh at azaria , green and tucci\\'s antics from time to time ( ironic , eh . . . what \\nabout the leads , dammit ! ) and liked the premise behind the film ( before i saw the finished product , of course ) . \\na dud all the way around . \\nbtw , all the talk about this film was that julia roberts was to be in a fat suit for one scene ( her character is supposed to have lost 60 pounds ) , so when the scene finally came , i did get a little excited about what it might look like and then . . . well , \\nit basically just looked like julia roberts in a fat suit ! \\nugh . \\ni think i\\'m gonna start drinking again after this lame-ass movie . \\nc\\'mon hollywood , enough with the crud ! \\nwhere\\'s joblo coming from ? \\nbeautiful ( 1/10 ) - my best friend\\'s wedding ( 7/10 ) - notting hill ( 5/10 ) -

descent into sinful pleasure , decay , and debauchery \" are hard to watch . \\nbad 2000\\'s movies that resemble bad 1980s films are even harder to watch . \\nshadow hours falls into the latter category , a mish-mashed train wreck of b-movie actors ( including michael dorn , aka star trek\\'s worf ) , an uninteresting plot , vain attempts at capitalizing on the \" underground \" scenes of seedy los angeles , and really , really bad directing and horrendous music video-esque ballistic editing that was taught to me in film school right before i decided to drop out . \\nthe film revolves around the life of michael holloway ( balthazar getty ) who is trying to restart his life with his one-dimensional wife chloe ( rebecca gayheart ) after a nasty bout of drug and alcohol addictions . \\nmichael takes a job of working the graveyard shift at the local gas station and is bombarded by the ugliness and weirdness of the nightlife of l . a . one night , he meets a strange gent named stuart ( mr . buckaroo banzai , peter weller ) . \\nhe drives a porsche , smokes french cigarettes , and drones on about life , eventually coaxing mike into exploring the \" underbelly \" of l . a . together , a tour of punk bars , s&m clubs , and bare-knuckle fights . \\nthe film then throws in a murder mystery with a cop played peter greene , acting like he wants to get the chance at a reprisal of his role in the mask 2 . the film then simply dissolves into a cheap rip-off of dante\\'s inferno mixed with an old stephen j . cannell television pilot . \\nthe pace of the film is jarring and utterly without focus . \\nother horrors include the endless montages of people pumping gas and the charlie sheen , johnny depp , richard grieco-esque acting of balthazar getty . \\npeter weller clearly knows his career is completely gone and doesn\\'t give two shits about it . \\nand after the cheap exploitation of bondage clubs , dance clubs , and brothels - damn , isn\\'t anyone safe any more from the ugly eye of hollywood ! ? \\nway back in 1984 , a great but crazy director named abel ferrara made his worse film and called it fear city . \\nshadow hours reminds me of an almost perfect sequel . \\ndirector/writer : isaac eaton producers : peter alevey , andrea mia , shon greenblatt , balthazar getty starring : balthazar getty , peter weller , rebecca gayheart , peter greene

croatia \" and \" croatians \" were unheard , even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations . \\nthe rare exception was the dogs of war , 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth\\'s bestselling novel , yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury , by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context . \\nin a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people , probably terrorists , who happen to remove parts of arm dealers\\' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise . \\nsame line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place - dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business , politics and crime . \\nthe movie protagonist , shannon ( christopher walken ) is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe . \\nhis latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro . \\nshannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba , bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away . \\nafter being arrested and tortured by kimba\\'s secret police , shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north ( colin blakely ) . \\nupon return , he is approached by mining company again , but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d\\'etat against kimba . \\nshannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war . \\nthing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies , especially those made in 1980s , is its authenticity , almost close to documentary . \\nit shouldn\\'t surprise anyone , because the author of the novel , frederick forsyth , made reputation by blending fiction with real life , thus creating interesting , exciting yet very believable plots for his books . \\nthose plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers , and one of them , zinnemman\\'s the day of the jackal , is now considered a classic in that genre . \\nthis one deals with soldiers of fortune , ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of 1960s and 1970s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires . \\nunlike wild geese , that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure , script by george malko and gary de vore ( author whose death last year became real life mystery ) is serious , and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work . \\nthe movie doesn\\'t try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes ; they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda . \\nchristopher walken played in many movies , yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role . \\nhis performance in this film perhaps isn\\'t breathtaking , yet adequate . \\nhis notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned , world- weary man whose alienation from the \" normal \" way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends . \\nalthough the movie doesn\\'t lack capable actors , their roles are miniature compared with walken\\'s , and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character . \\nhowever , those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war - tom berenger , paul freeman , jo beth williams , victoria tennant ( in brief cameo ) , and biggest surprise is ed o\\'neill ( of married with children fame ) as shannon\\'s reluctant colleague . \\nthis was the first major production for john irvin , and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable , yet second class director . \\nwith the good script he can make very good movie , with the bad script he can make real mess . \\nluckily , the dogs of war had a good script . \\nirvin\\'s direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel . \\nthe only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon , used on the wrong places . \\nin the final battle scene , where we can see mercenaries at work , irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics , unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes . \\nunfortunately , by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didn\\'t help . \\nbut , despite those shortcomings , this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty , realistic political drama .', 'late in down to you , the lead female character ( julia stiles ) states her greatest fear is having an \" artificial conversation \" with her boyfriend ( freddie prinze jr . ) . \\nthe irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out , fallen asleep , or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy . \\nthe film is a multi-million dollar testament to everything artificial . \\nfilled with characters , motivation , plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster . \\nprinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles\\' freshman co-ed . \\nat first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out-doing the previous in how \" cute \" it can be . \\nthe happy couple \" psychoanalyze \" each other ; they pick out a song because , as prinze\\'s dj mother ( lucie arnez ) explains , every couple needs a song ; he smells her shampoo ; she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love . \\nthen , in standard romantic comedy style , things fall apart . \\nwhy ? \\nwell , because they have to . \\notherwise the couple can\\'t make up and live ( presumably ) happily ever after . \\ndown to you exists outside the realm of normal logic . \\nscenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism , but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead . \\na picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre , not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together , or even knowing each other , but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat . \\nthe supporting characters are remarkably flat , and insultingly ridiculous as well . \\nstiles\\' best friend ( rosario dawson ) is a pot head , prinze\\'s roommate ( shawn hatosy ) is a girl crazy fool who can\\'t meet women , and then there are the porn stars ( zak orth and selma blair ) . \\nhe is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television , does the college lecture circuit , and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film . \\nyou know , the average porn star . \\nthe costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he\\'s on screen , the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes . \\nshe is a porn star mostly so we know she\\'s slutty , so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted . \\nattempts at drama ( which means julia is going to cry ) include a pregnancy scare and the big break up . \\nthese characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes . \\nwhat happened here ? \\nthe cast is full of likable , promising , young actors ( stiles especially seems to be going places ) . \\nwriter/director kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off . \\nin fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last year\\'s extremely unpleasant the story of us , for teen audiences . \\nthe direction is film-school-grad obvious . \\nit\\'s stylish in a hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen , a pointless parody of \" cops , \" characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters , and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion . \\nplus , the whole story is told flashback style , narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera . \\nthis is the second film in a row ( following wing commander ) starring freddie prinze jr . which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she\\'s all that . \\nif he

movie than the frenetic , childish and improbable _matrix_ . \\na cutting edge computer scientist , hannon fuller ( played by the charming armin mueller-stahl ) , is murdered . \\nhis associate ,

( gretchen mol ) , more bodies , and a deepening mystery about simulated worlds complicate the picture . \\n_the thirteenth floor_ unfolds slowly and telegraphs its punches , choosing to elicit the more complex emotional response of empathy and anticipation rather than the cheap one of mere surprise . \\nthe result is a movie that is a failure from two conventional points of view . \\nfirst , its plot revelations can be foreseen if one has carefully followed its complex storyline . \\nsecond and more seriously , it demands that its audience think and feel . \\nno wonder it fell through the cracks . \\ndone in film noir style as a murder mystery , this is a relatively deep movie that functions on several levels . \\nmany audiences will simply be bewildered by it , rather than engaged , which is a shame , because this movie amply repays a little emotional and intellectual investment . \\ni recommend a second viewing simply to get the flavor of the frequent ironic foreshadowing in the opening parts of the movie . \\ndespite its philosophical challenges , _the thirteenth floor_ derives its emotional force from the love story between jane fuller ( mol ) and douglas hall ( bierko ) , as well as the close friendship between douglas hall and hannon fuller . \\nin that sense it is more akin to _gattaca_ than _the matrix_ , which , for all of its cute philosophical byplay , is an adolescent movie with no emotional depth whatsoever . \\nthe moment when jane fuller confesses her love for douglas hall is at once satisfying , wrenching and intellectually challenging . \\nin its final moments the film even takes on itself , when david , jane\\'s husband , who has come to enjoy killing , accuses her of being the sick one . \\nalthough there is a victory for the leading characters , this resolution suggests a disturbing element of fantasy in jane , and thus a deep-seated character flaw . \\nin fact , hannon fuller\\'s activities in the simulated world , the behavior of jane\\'s husband , and the effects of entering the simulation on douglas hall all hint at similar issues with those characters . \\nthis is not a film of good people beset from without by great

\"cinema has been around for about a hundred years now . ? \\nit's not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film , but i'd like to think that i'm beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time . \\nrecently , i've seen the films of hitchcock , capra , fellini , godard , kurosawa , chaplin , lang , and many others . \\n ? those men were talented

movie . ? \\ntrue , its budget is a lot more money than i'll ever see in my lifetime . ? \\nand there's not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money . ? \\nin fact , i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film , had they thought it would've been more profitable . \\ni certainly don't care what their intentions were , because michael bay ( the rock ) is such a skilled director that i doubt he'd ever make a film that is difficult to sit through . \\nof course , skillful direction doesn't complete the package , but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together . \\nthe story is well-thought out ( and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place ) , the acting is terrific , the script is sharp , and -- get this -- there are characters . \\nyes , you read that right . \\narmageddon actually has characters you can care about ! \\nif you don't like this film , then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this can be . \\nif you've seen deep impact , then you know the basic framework for the story . \\nit turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film . \\nso , it's up to the u . s . government to stop it . \\n ( why the u . s . is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated . ) \\ntheir plan -- to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid , drill down several hundred feet , and detonate a nuclear warhead within . \\nthe head driller is harry stamper ( bruce willis ) . \\nhis group of men is a colorful bunch , including a . j . \\n ( ben affleck ) , chick ( will patton ) , and rockhound ( steve buscemi ) . \\nthere's also an interesting triangle formed between a . j . , harry , and grace ( liv tyler ) , who is harry's daughter . \\na . j . \\nand grace are , of course , romantically intertwined , and dad isn't too happy with the situation . \\nit's absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is you'd like to call armageddon . \\nit's not about story -- it's about viscera and action , and thrills-a-minute , and all that stuff . \\nit's incidental , really , that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable , because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds' thought to what actually happens . \\nbut bay is the one to congratulate in this case , for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better . \\ni think most of the budget went to cameras alone , because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles . \\ntake the spectacular opening scene , for instance , in which a meteor shower obliterates new york . \\na meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building , which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars . \\nthe action itself might take five seconds in real life , but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways . \\ni like his quick-edit style , because it's abrasive and exhausting to watch . \\nit's also very loud , and obnoxiously noisy at times . \\nbut it's fun to be obnoxious sometimes . \\nthe special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame . \\ndeep impact , visually , has absolutely nothing on armageddon , and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable . \\nspecial effects are very important in a film like this : if they're not good , then the image is not convincing , and the film doesn't work . \\neverything here looks bright and explosive -- from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers , all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid . \\nthe effects that don't look totally real are still a pleasure to behold , and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice-looking that it actually qualifies as art . \\nof course , all of this would add up to little more than an above-average light show , if i didn't get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action . \\nthe film is two and a half hours long , and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action . \\nmuch of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters' subplots . \\ni won't suggest that these are complex characters , but their problems are real , and the emotions aren't put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way . \\nin fact , there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up , and that's a lot more than i can say about deep impact , which was banking on the feel-good parts of its story . \\nbruce willis is terrific , and i'm glad to see him bigger than life again ( recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing ) . \\ntyler and affleck are great together , and make a convincing couple -- all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level . \\npatton , who is a magnificent actor , thankfully is not wasted here , and the minor subplot revolving around his ex-wife and son is very moving . \\nthe comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare ( who plays a crazy russian astronaut ) is nifty , and keeps the film lively and funny . \\ni wasn't challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon , and i don't mind too much . \\nbut the film doesn't insult my intelligence -- it's pitched perfectly to entertain , which is what all it really wants to do . \\nit's not mindless and escapist , but well-crafted cinema . \\nit might have been created for the wrong reasons , but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good , in spite of the producers and the budget . \\ni'm not saying that films like this are risky moves . \\nwhat i am saying is that armageddon is a big , loud , expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms .\", 'plot : something about a bunch of kids going into a haunted house and playing out parodies of other horror and non-horror movies . \\noh yeah ,

linger are the still ones where rylance and fox separately , pensively attempt to carry on with their makeshift household routines . \\nthese are often captured in lingering , unblinking wide shots

trendsetters ) , you\\'d be hard pressed to find a single uninteresting image . \\nintimacy takes an interest in its sordid world of the lower-middle class , with lonely pubs and busy shopping streets -- it also understands the people who inhabit those spaces , viewing them with sympathy scraped raw . \\nan evaluation would be incomplete without highlighting the great timothy spall ( the robust scene-stealer of many a mike leigh collaboration ) . \\nas claire\\'s cuckolded husband , this jocular heavyweight plays out his handful of bitter pill scenes with the unforced menace and

has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival\\'s palme d\\'or , a $100 million-plus box office gross , and an oscar nomination ? all for his sophomore outing , pulp fiction . \\nsince then , the talented film maker has been virtually invisible , surfacing briefly as a co-director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire-fest , from dusk till dawn . \\nin between , he has moonlighted as an \" actor \" with several decidedly unmemorable performances . \\nnow , with much fanfare and anticipation , tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort , jackie brown . \\nand , while this motion picture , adapted from elmore leonard\\'s novel , rum punch , offers solid entertainment , those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed . \\nfor the most part , jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie . \\nthe story , which starts out slowly , develops into a twisty affair , with double-crosses and triple-crosses . \\nand the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks : witty dialogue , unexpected gunfire , \\'70s pop tunes , and close-ups of womens\\' bare feet . \\nyet , for all of that , the production is something of a letdown . \\nthe sheer , in-your-face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent . \\nthe mostly-straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn\\'t match up favorably to the non-linear style of tarantino\\'s previous efforts ? an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives . \\nand there aren\\'t nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around . \\nthere\\'s a samuel l . jackson monologue about guns , a jackson/chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk , and a jackson/robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson/travolta material from pulp fiction , but that\\'s about it . \\njackie brown\\'s lone \" innovation \" is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives . \\nthis isn\\'t exactly an original technique ? it has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa\\'s rashomon and most recently in edward zwick\\'s courage under fire . \\nhowever , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of- view , tarantino\\'s sole purpose for using it appears to be because it\\'s unconventional . \\nhad the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages , nothing would have been lost . \\nas a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity . \\nfor the second picture in a row , tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a \\'70s icon . \\nthis time around , instead of john travolta , it\\'s blaxploitation queen pam grier ( foxy brown has become jackie brown ) . \\nin one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier\\'s career , tarantino uses a \\'70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits . \\nthere are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt-kicking ) . \\ngrier is jackie brown , a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states . \\nshe\\'s working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning , despite pressure from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a federal official . \\nno longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie , ordell arranges for a bail bondsman , max cherry ( robert forster , tv\\'s \" banyon \" ) to post the necessary $10 , 000 , then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal . \\njackie passes ordell\\'s test , however , and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 of ordell\\'s money into the united states without tipping off the feds . \\nsoon , just about everyone is after that money , including jackie , max , ray , ordell\\'s perpetually oversexed and drugged-out girlfriend , melanie ( bridget fonda ) , and his right-hand man , louis ( robert de niro ) . \\nunsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l . jackson , but ordell isn\\'t nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction . \\nin addition to looking fantastic , pam grier is also quite good , although hers is not an oscar- caliber performance ( although she might get a nomination ) . \\nrobert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough-guys-who-rarely- smile roles . \\nbridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini , to provide a little twisted comedy , and to satisfy tarantino\\'s foot fetish . \\nrobert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy- looking , middle-aged actor . \\nthe film , which clocks in at several minutes over the two-and-a- half hour mark , is probably too long for the material , but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) . \\ntarantino keeps things moving along nicely , with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself . \\nwhen it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) , jackie brown is a second-tier effort

who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth . \\ntogether the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet . \\nto make mst3k work , the film-within-the-film naturally has to be as horrible as possible , and although the tv-series introduced us to several worse films than this island earth , it's a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty .

so long . \\noccasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously . \\nalthough it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment , it's better than overkilling the whole concept post haste . \\nmst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly , but if you don't know what you're in for , it could be a jarring disappointment . \\nalthough i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars , it is a movie to be seen on home video , late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway , and with a large , saracastic crowd - new year's at midnight for example , which is when i saw it . \\nwarning : although mst3k has more to its end credits than most ( the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun ) , they are actually more annoying than most . \\nthe name slandering and asinine one-liners were extremely unfunny , and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight , it put a heavy

the studio whose subsidiary , dimension films , is jay and silent bob\\'s distributor . \\nothers deserving accolades include ben affleck , matt damon , directors gus van zant and wes craven and the mighty george lucas . \\nthis is a laugh-filled , foul-mouthed road film with jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( smith ) hitching to hollywood to sabotage miramax\\'s production of bluntman and chronic , comic book characters based on the two jersey slackers . \\njay\\'s convoluted reasoning is that if the film is shut down , people on the internet will stop insulting him and bob , even though it is not him and bob the people are dissing , but rather their comic book counterparts . \\nno matter , the duo begin their long trek hitching rides across the country . \\nbut first they get some tips from a veteran hitchhiker , played by george carlin , who tells them to follow \" the book \" - the rules of the road . \\nof course jay\\'s interpretation immediately gets the duo in trouble with a friendly nun ( carrie fisher ) who offers them a ride . \\njay and silent bob contains enough laughs that the movie\\'s weaker aspects - which include a lame subplot about a girl gang of diamond thieves as well as a buffoonish federal park ranger played by will ferrell - can be easily tolerated . \\nreally , how can you not laugh at a film in which our heroes are picked up by the mystery van , and jay has a pot-induced hallucination concerning velma and daphne . \\nthe movie\\'s highlight , though , is near the finale . \\nin hollywood , jay and silent bob sneak onto the miramax lot where they crash the set and are mistaken for extras of the latest affleck-damon picture , good will hunting 2 : hunting season . \\nhere we are privy to a hilarious conversation between affleck and damon in which the two put down each other\\'s careers and film choices . \\nand the laughs continue to grow . \\nnext up is jason ( american pie ) biggs and james ( dawson\\'s creek ) van der beek , the actors chosen to portray bluntman and chronic . \\nthe pair mistake jay and silent bob for their stunt doubles . \\nfinally , comes a star wars homage featuring one of the stars of that legendary feature . \\nthis bit will leave you howling . \\nsmith\\'s obvious affection for pop culture icons is evident in the way he shoots these scenes and handles his performers . \\nhe allows them to play it all tongue-in-cheek . \\ntheir fun comes through the screen to the audience . \\nit is too bad that this is jay and silent bob\\'s swan song . \\nthe characters have grown since their supporting role debuts in clerks . \\nbut smith realizes that times have changed , and he doesn\\'t want his creations to overstay their welcome . \\nso smith has provided them with just the right kind of exit , saving the best for last . \\ngoodbye jay and silent bob . \\nat least you\\'re going out with a blast .', 'capsule : earthy , experimental , difficult , shockingly frank ( even for 1997 ! ) , and ultimately refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops . \\nthe first few minutes of sweet sweetback\\'s baad asssss song ( yes , i checked -- that\\'s the correct number of ss ) are without dialogue , just eerie montages of sounds . \\na young boy , obviously malnourished , is taken in and fed up by several loving mother-surrogate figures . \\nthen one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation ( underneath the title credits ) that\\'s far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts -- probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life , something we\\'re not used to seeing on screen . \\nthis is one tough movie to swallow , no matter who you are , but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately . \\n ( i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences . ) \\nthe plot is simple but not simpleminded . \\nsweetback , hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man , breaks his bonds and runs like hell . \\nalong the way he moves through a good many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies -- or at all , for that matter : the slums , the missions , the ghetto . \\nin other , lesser , movies , sweetback would be machine-gunning everything in sight and the end credits would roll over a pile of bodies ; in this one , we get taken on a kind of a tour of the depressing and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted . \\nssbas first appeared in 1971 and was promptly rated x ( \" by an all-white jury \" , as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns ) , and it\\'s hardly surprising why . \\nthere\\'s a good deal of sex in the movie , but it\\'s handled in a way that\\'s unsettlingly frank -- a frankness that spills over into the rest of the movie . \\nin one scene , sweetback visits a friend\\'s house in the hope of getting sanctuary there , and the other man chats him up while on the toilet . \\nwe\\'re not used to coming this close to people in real life , let alone in the movies -- especially not people who are not made out to be glamorous . \\nthe movie is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today , but probably because of that seem curiously fresh and new in van peebles\\' hands . \\none scene , in which a man is interrogated by the cops , is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off a gun inches from his ears , and suggest his deafness through a cleverly edited soundtrack . \\nanother note : ssbas is not so much anti-white ( that would be too easy ) as anti-authority , and as the movie goes on to demonstrate , authority exists in many forms -- governments , churches , and even the paranoid inside of one\\'s own mind . \\nssbas is ultimately about thirsting for freedom -- and it looks like we could use a little more of that in our movie diet , god knows .', 'what are we going to do with jim carrey ? \\nviewers of television\\'s \" in living

mid-50\\'s , \" twenty-one \" . \\non this trivial game show , contestants were placed in isolation booths and then answered questions corresponding to a category of their choice , on which they wagered an amount of points on . \\nthe game went on until a player reached twenty one points on felt they had earned enough points to win . \\nbut , after ratings began to fall when players were struggling to break the zero mark , the producers decided to fix the game by giving the answers to a contestant before the game began . \\nquiz show illustrates the true stories of two particular contestants , herbie stempel and charles van doren . \\nstempel ( john turturro ) , a former g . i . \\nand your jewish man raising a family . \\nstempel has been the reigning champion on \" twenty-one \" for many weeks and has accumulated thousands of dollars . \\nin his mind , he is the best thing on television and the people love him . \\nalthough , in the mind of the show\\'s producers , herbie stempel is getting old . \\ndan enright ( david paymer ) , in particular , feels that the people are tired of seeing a \" jewish guy from queens with bad teeth \" and that the kids need someone better to look up to . \\ntherefore , they need to find another contestant whom would be a worthy role model and the people will look up to and cheer to win . \\nsomeone who can defeat stempel , even if they have to resort to cheating . \\nenter charles van doren ( ralph fiennes ) , a well-educated professor from a widely recognized family . \\nvan doren had decided to try out for the game show \" tic tac dough \" because his friends thought he would be good at that sort of thing . \\nbut when albert freedman ( hank azaria ) , enright\\'s assistant , spots van doren , the two decide that they have found their soon-to-be-ruler of the \" twenty-one \" kingdom . \\nvan doren is not too keen on the idea of receiving the answers ahead of time , so enright tells stempel that he is going to give the wrong answer , on purpose , in order to lose the game . \\nafter stempel loses the \" throne \" to van doren , he starts to feel cheated ( which he should ) . \\nmeanwhile , on his own , dick goodwin ( rob morrow ) , a harvard law graduate , has decided to start an investigation on \" twenty-one \" to try and find out if there have been any wrongdoings . \\nhis investigation yields shocking results and leads to a trial for enright and the others involved . \\nquiz show is an extremely well done movie , and robert redford\\'s direction is especially superb . \\nthe performances turned in by john turturro , ralph fiennes , and rob morrow are very good , although it seems that turturro stands out more than any . \\nquiz show is also very precise when it comes to explicating the true events that inspired the film . \\ndefinitely a film you should not miss .', 'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\ni was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species . \\nsquandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley\\'s a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ain\\'t ) . \\nmiraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they\\'d dare tempt fate and go for another round . \\nso here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid . \\nthe film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can . \\nin other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there\\'s a catch -- he\\'s an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who\\'s now infected with alien dna . \\npatrick\\'s overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring . \\nand when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half-human , half-alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick\\'s primary focus turns to her -- \" if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable \" warns dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction . \\nspecies ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around . \\nhowever , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b-movie is quickly answered . \\nmr . brancato\\'s original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches . \\nlike the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there\\'s a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious . \\nlast time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker\\'s psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- \" something bad happened here . \" \\nthis time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter \" this is awful . \" \\nand she\\'s not even empathic ! \\nand when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully-paced suspense sequence , eve , who\\'s telepathically linked to her alien/human-hybrid counterpart ( whatever ) , helpfully tells our alien-hunting protagonists , \" he\\'s going to rape her . \" \\nwhile species ii is often unintentionally hilarious , at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own . \\nthere\\'s an amusing , tongue-in-cheek bit of product placement ( which doesn\\'t really make much sense , but i appreciated the sentiment ) , as well as some supermarket-related hijinx ( \" he\\'s in aisle 1 ! \" \\ninforms eve ) . \\nif the film maintained this sort of light-hearted tone , it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch , but , to its detriment , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody , effects-ladened anticlimactic conclusion . \\nmuch of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense , and there are such gaping plot holes that it\\'s terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief . \\nthe implausibilities are endless : what about the toxic bomb in eve\\'s brain ? \\nwhy are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual ? \\nmy favourite was the slow-motion sequence in the film where eve , sporting superhuman strength , is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks . \\nthis is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief , incredulous that it\\'s being foisted upon the public . \\nreturning headlines michael madsen ( who reprises tough guy press lennox ) and ms . helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay , but there\\'s realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis . \\nmykelti williamson ( portraying astronaut dennis gamble ) churns out an all-too-familiar spin on a generic brash-mouthed character , and fine character actors george dzundza ( playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process ) and james cromwell ( patrick\\'s neglectful father , senator ross ) are utterly wasted in the film . \\nmr . lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty-eyed look , while returning vixen ms . henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene ( and acquits herself nicely ) , but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing ( or none at all ) . \\nms . henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series , claiming that \" she\\'s so empowered . \" \\na lethal half-alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion -- now * that\\'s * what i call empowerment .', '\" the tailor of panama \" is a different kind of spy movie . \\ndespite the presence of pierce brosnan , there is nary a hint of james bond flash here . \\ninstead of big action scenes , leering super villains and empty-headed femme fatales , we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation . \\nbased on the novel by john le carr ? , who also co-wrote the screenplay , the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year : a solid , well-told story . \\nbrosnan plays andy osnard , a british operative walking on thin ice . \\nhis british superiors ship him off to panama , making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement . \\nosnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co-workers and his new home base . \\nwhen shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that , since the creation of the panama canal , the structure is the sole connection between north and south america , he barely keeps from yawning . \\nbrosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007 , investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end . \\nsearching for a way to get information on the government , osnard sets his sights on harry pendel ( geoffrey rush ) , an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite . \\nharry claims to be a transplant from britain\\'s renowned saville row , but osnard knows his secret : the tailor is an ex-con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle\\'s shop in an insurance scam . \\nhe also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt , having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm . \\nosnard offers harry a way out . \\nhe will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele . \\neager to comply , harry offers what he knows , then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing . \\nbefore long , he is forced to spy on his loving wife , louisa ( jamie lee curtis ) , an aide to the canal director . \\nharry\\'s little lies build , eventually taking on a life of their own . \\nosnard turns in reports about the \" silent opposition , \" a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal . \\nthe bogus revelation proves explosive , leading to meetings in washington d . c . over how to best protect the vital waterway . \\nmeanwhile , osnard wallows in his newfound status , enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive co-worker . \\nand harry grows ever more fretful , fearing the consequences if his clients , not to mention his wife , learn about his lies . \\ngeoffrey rush is wonderful as harry , fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings , all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor . \\nrush makes harry a credible figure , presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity . \\nafter gaining fame playing larger than life characters , rush flips everything around for this role , using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems . \\nalthough she gets far too little screen time , jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her . \\nof the central characters , she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine self-confidence . \\ncurtis is one of my favorite female actors ; whiplash smart , sultry and charismatic , she deserves more than supporting roles . \\nspeaking of supporting characters , there are some great ones here . \\nharold pinter is amusing as harry\\'s uncle benny , who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways . \\nalso shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as a corrupt banker and dylan baker , who is a riot as a united states general straight out of the dr . strangelove school of armed patriotism . \\nbut the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson , both outstanding as two wounded activists . \\ntheir presence adds weight to the story , reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men , there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal . \\ndirector john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location . \\ninstead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop , he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there . \\nthe metropolis , described by one character as \" casablanca without heroes \" pulsates with life , underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people . \\n \" the tailor of panama \" succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than a simple entertainment .', 'in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black . \\nsir anthony hopkins , playing a super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner . \\nhis oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake . \\nthe daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes . \\nhopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts . \\nwhichever one you like , dear , he says . \\nand the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries . \\ni liked that scene for two reasons . \\nfirst , the cakes looked really cool . \\nsecond , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act . \\nmeet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot . \\nit\\'s easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it\\'s even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) . \\nthe difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess . \\ni know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy . \\ncase in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie . \\nhowever , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani . \\n ( it\\'s not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . ) \\nit shouldn\\'t take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr . pitt . \\nand indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished . \\nwell , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous . \\nso , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately . \\nanyway , the deceased lawyer\\'s body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role . \\nthe idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world . \\nif this weren\\'t hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish-out-of-water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who\\'s wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn\\'t know how to act in our society . \\nit also doesn\\'t help that the character of death is written so inconsistently . \\nhe claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one ) . \\nhe speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois . \\nhe knows everything about some characters , nothing about others . \\nand as played by brad pitt , he\\'s not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he\\'s just there . \\nit\\'s as if someone told pitt , \" never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty . \" \\nit\\'s as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie . \\ni\\'ve used the phrase \" angel of death \" in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt\\'s performance with this year\\'s best angel performance , nicolas cage\\'s in city of angels . \\nwhere pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows . \\nwhere cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant . \\ncage struck instant chemical sparks with co-star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani\\'s character is so shallow that she can\\'t see beyond pitt\\'s good looks . \\nthe movie\\'s other top name is a much better actor , but that doesn\\'t save meet joe black . \\nsir anthony hopkins isn\\'t given much better material to work with , unfortunately . \\nhe plays one of these good-hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood . \\n ( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins\\'s character more realistically evil . ) \\nhopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world . \\nof course , no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder . \\nbut i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire . \\nhopkins pretty much goes to the office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation . \\nfans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated , i\\'m sure . \\ni stayed awake all the way through meet joe black , and i\\'m asking myself why . \\nmovies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest , which is what i\\'m going to do now . \\ngo spend time with your family , go volunteer for a local charity , heck , go take a nap . \\ndon\\'t go see meet joe black , because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death .

the title is none other than action star sylvester stallone ( in comeback #19 , i think ) , who plays a quiet , hermit-like bomber who was once a bomb expert with the army or something , but who

the other hand , this is the same woman who made her jaw-droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis\\' king kong . \\nand , much as lange would probably prefer movie-goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume , every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it , if only in quality . \\nhush is one such example . \\nlange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn\\'t such a prime example of motion picture tedium . \\nthe film opens , as many so-called \" psychological thrillers \" do , by posing as a light drama . \\nwe are introduced to jackson ( johnathon schaech , last encounter in tom hanks\\' that thing you do ! ) and helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love . \\njackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother , martha ( lange ) . \\nthe moment i first saw martha , i started looking for fangs . \\nsoon , the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant ( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm ) . \\nonce that goal is accomplished , she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives . \\nas long as she gets her way , martha is a perfectly amicable person , but when helen defies her , it\\'s a declaration of war . \\nhush has three very simple problems : it\\'s incredibly dumb , it\\'s incredibly boring , and it\\'s incredibly predictable ( at least up to the stupefying ending ) . \\nthis film has absolutely nothing to recommend it , with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snow-covered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow\\'s bare buttocks . \\nfrankly , it\\'s embarrassing to watch a respected actress of lange\\'s stature give a performance like this -- it\\'s like a bad blanche dubois ( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire ) . \\nmeanwhile , paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines , and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object . \\nas in all psychological thrillers , the battle lines are clearly drawn . \\nhere , it\\'s mom and against wife , with jackson caught in the middle . \\nof course , since schaech\\'s character is poorly-developed and badly acted , it\\'s impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation . \\nmaybe someone should ask him if he\\'s familiar with oedipus . \\nmartha is , of course , the evil one . \\nhow do we know she\\'s evil ? \\nshe smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor -- two sure signs that the devil is at work . \\non the other hand , helen is a good girl . \\nthe evidence for this is that she\\'s nice to old ladies and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents . \\nthat\\'s about it for character development . \\nbeyond that point , hush is just a series of increasingly hard-to-swallow coincidences , contrivances , and moronic plot twists . \\nhowever , the first 85 minutes are just a warm-up for the ending , which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying . \\ni can\\'t imagine anyone , no matter what they thought of the movie as a whole , liking this conclusion . \\neither there was some serious last-minute editing or someone left out a few pages of the script . \\nbefore the climax , i disliked hush ; by the time the end credits started , i hated it . \\nviewers invest something in every movie they watch , no matter how good or bad it is . \\ncheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable . \\nmost entries into this worn-out , worm-eaten genre aren\\'t especially good . \\nfilms like consenting adults , the hand that rocks the cradle , and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along . \\nin general , however , they\\'re directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension . \\nthat\\'s not the case with really bad thrillers like this , which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation -- the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care . \\nindeed , the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid .', \"i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick . \\ntake the professional , for example . \\nit boasts extremely glossy cinematography , a couple of recognizable name actors , and a couple of fairly impressive explosions . \\nit's also basically about violence and cheap titilation , and features a central relationship between a middle-aged man and a twelve-year-old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension . \\nthe professional is all over the map , and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant . \\nthe professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon ( jean reno ) , brutally efficient but also very isolated . \\none day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door . \\nher name is matilda ( natalie portman ) , and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d . e . a . \\nagent norman stansfield ( gary oldman ) after matilda's father tried to rip him off . \\nleon reluctantly takes matilda in , then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother . \\nthe two become closer , which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much , and sets out to eliminate them both . \\nwriter/director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita , a slick potboiler about a female assassin . \\nthere is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film ; with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast , he has created a film chock full of moody close-ups and evocative lighting . \\nbut beneath the shiny wrapper , there isn't nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe . \\nthe relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop . \\nleon is mostly a collection of quirky traits , all intended to show us that for a hired killer , he's really not so bad a guy : he drinks lots of milk , takes meticulous care of a potted plant , and enjoys gene kelly movies . \\njean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality , but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda . \\nnatalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality , but she doesn't have too much to work with , either . \\nbesson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life , and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing . \\na silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place , as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover ; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag . \\ngary oldman's entire part is something of a cheap gag , wild-eyed and way over the top , but at least he is interesting to watch . \\nthere isn't a real person to be found anywhere in the professional , which isn't always a problem in an action thriller , except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more . \\na more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve-year-old in a really distasteful way . \\nthere were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda's relationship : confront it head on , or ignore it entirely . \\nbut besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he's going to show them a forbidden love story , while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman's rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing . \\nthis is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol , or the blood which is spilled aplenty . \\na great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world can't disguise that fact .\", 'after the recent animated debacles

\\nfor some reason that i may figure out later , i don\\'t know why the time , money and effort were put into the making of \" the musketeer . \" \\nit may be that someone had the clever idea of

\" crouching tiger , hidden dragon . \" \\nthe result is a mix of genres that don\\'t mesh well . \\nelements of the ritz brothers-style comedy ( for those few who remember that comedic troupe from the 1939 \" the three musketeers \" ) , the man with no name from \" a fistful of dollars \" ( d\\'artagnan demands that the bad guys apologize to his horse in a direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western ) and hong kong action choreography are all utilized in the original script by gene quintano . \\nthe result is an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the \" matrix \" crowd . \\nalexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre and characters . \\nthe real problem with the \" the musketeer \" lies in the casting of the two lead , romantically intertwined characters , d\\'artagnan and francesca ( mena suvari ) . \\nchambers has the boyishly handsome good looks for the character , a la chris o\\'donnell , but lacks any onscreen charisma . \\nsuvari has the doe-eyed , pretty looks as the chambermaid who has the ear of the queen , but she , too , does not have the chemistry to command the screen . \\nif \" the musketeer \" makes them any money , they should invest in acting lessons . \\nstronger performers may have helped to raise the bar on this one . \\nthe supporting cast is , on the surface , impressive . \\ncatherine denueve plays the queen of france and lends her character an air of royalty , dignity and humor , especially when she plays off of d\\'artagnan\\'s mentor , planchet ( jean-pierre castaldi , who reminds of andre the giant in \" the princess bride ) . \\nstephen rea looks good in the part of the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu , but is given very little to help flesh out his character . \\ntim roth is the kind of bad guy you love to hate as the cardinal\\'s chief henchman , febre . \\nhe is so bad he makes simon legree look like a boy scout . \\nthe rest of the players , particularly the three musketeers aramis ( nick moran , \" lock , stock and two smoking barrels \" ) , porthos ( steve spiers ) and athos ( jan gregor kremp ) , are background fodder whose role is to come to d\\'artagnan\\'s aid when needed . \\npeter hyam\\'s does double duty as director and cinematography and may be too stretched to do both well . \\na stronger hand at the helm could have helped the mediocre performances of the leads and better utilized his veteran thesps . \\nphotography is straightforward action fare that goes through all the appropriate action flick motions - d\\'artagnan takes on a tavern full of thugs and bests them single-handed ; he fights a gang of febre\\'s henchmen aboard a speeding coach to protect the queen ( with the obligatory branches hanging over the road ) ; he goes one on one with his lifelong enemy , febre , who murdered d\\'artagnan\\'s folks years before . \\nit is all routine stuff . \\nthe renowned wire work developed by the hong kong action masters is used to artificial effect as the players leap , defying gravity , up walls and from horse to horse . \\nit works in a sci-fi film like \" the matrix \" or in a classical fantasy like \" crouching tiger , hidden dragon \" but just calls attention to itself in \" the musketeer . \" \\nat one point i could swear i saw the stunt wire being used . \\nit did not make me a believer and i am very disappointed . \\nwith a run time of 106 minutes it should have

tending a failing farm and finally becoming a police officer . \\nviggo mortensen is the wild brother , whose wild behavior seems to be a reaction to some ancient pain that he can't name , much less resolve . \\nthe film picks the story up on the day when mortensen returns from vietnam , and morse coincidentally encounters an armed youth fleeing for the state line . \\nit becomes clear that some kind of conflict threatens the link that the brothers once shared . \\nthe film is unobtrusive , simple , direct , plain , and sincere . \\nit isn't exactly perfect , but its sincerity is well invested in the struggle of the two brothers to identify the sickness before it destroys them . \\nlife seems to move forward a little faster than they can get a handle on their problems . \\nthis is a good film without big budget sets , or big name stars pushed into your face . \\nin fact , i'm reviewing it because i suspect that it may not get much marketing . \\nthere were perhaps 10 others at the showing i saw . \\ni thought the structure was clean and not oversimplified , though there are a few free-form sections which also work very well . \\nthe obligatory 1960s music seemed a little cliche , but what are you going to do--this movie * does * take place in the 1960s after all . \\nin my opinion , it is worth full-price admission .\", 'you would think that this film\\'s dismal failure would be due to american filmmakers getting hold of a brilliant british comedy and \" americanizing \" it . \\nyou\\'d be wrong , since full blame can be placed on the very folks who wrote and created the series : rowan atkinson , robin driscoll , and richard curtis . \\nshould you ever happen to meet those chaps , do me a favor . \\ngrab them by the hair and yell really loudly in their ear , \" what were you thinking ? ! \\nhave you ever heard the phrase \\'if it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it\\' ? ! \" \\nthen walk away . \\nthe film concerns mr . bean ( atkinson ) and his visit to america while escorting the painting of \" whistler\\'s mother \" to an american buyer ( played by burt reynolds , in the type of bit part that his success in \" boogie nights \" should hopefully do away with ) . \\nnow how or why mr . bean is sent on this trip makes no sense , and i can\\'t even describe how the film explains it . \\nthe point is that mr . bean comes to america and causes wacky trouble . \\nproblems problems problems , where to begin ? \\nfirst , the score music from the tv show has been completely replaced by score that is either at times one note away from the score from \" beetlejuice \" or one note away from the score from \" rob roy \" . \\nthen , the song choices are totally uninspired . \\n \" good vibrations \" ? \\n \" i love l . a . \" ? \\nwow , don\\'t put any thought into that guys . \\nalso , bean makes way too much noise in the film . \\nthe character doesn\\'t speak much , but in the series you really only heard the laughter of the audience , and maybe the occasional murmur from mr . bean . \\neach episode was like a chaplin silent movie . \\nin the film , bean is constantly moaning , grunting , whining , etc . it\\'s annoying , and just plain wrong for the character . \\nthe main problem though is that it\\'s just not funny . \\nwith each episode of the series there would be dozens of really great laughs crammed into less than 30 minutes . \\nmultiply that running time by three however , and the laughs steadily decrease . \\nthey even have the gaul to repeat jokes from the series . \\nsad , and creatively lazy . \\nas a series , \" mr . bean \" only ran for about 13 episodes or so . \\nwhy on earth did atkinson and the gang decide it was time to completely rework everything ? \\n13 half-hour episodes certainly hadn\\'t exhausted all possible situations . \\nall i can say positively for the film at this point is that it\\'s almost appropriate for all ages , if it wasn\\'t for a couple of scenes where it appears as though mr . bean is having sex with things . \\nand even that isn\\'t a very positive statement . \\nplease guys , go back to england and go back to television so you\\'ll make me laugh again . \\n[pg-13]', 'i can hear the question already . \\nwhat on earth do these two movies have in common ? \\nto most people , not a lot , except that both are by renowned directors . \\nas i saw them , however , both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers . \\nbut oh , how differently the packages affect their films . \\nwhile \" everyone\\'s \" production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special , jane campion\\'s imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones\\' script is . \\ni left \" everyone says i love you \" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face . \\ni left \" the portrait of a lady \" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , and i could have cared less . \\n \" everyone \" features nothing allen hasn\\'t done before storywise . \\nwoody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman ( roberts ) , and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong--again . \\nsimilar situations happen to his family and friends . \\nsome of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his \" early , funny \" films . \\nthe scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of \" take the money and run , \" his directorial debut . \\nhowever , nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this one-of-a-kind display of sheer good spirits . \\nin fact , in this movie , the feeling itself is what\\'s most important . \\nyes , the movie would have been better--among his very best , i think--if it had a meatier story . \\nbut what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling . \\nand what better way to express feeling than through music ? \\nlove is often best expressed in a song , and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart . \\nsome are a tad too goofy , such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor , but i admired allen for even putting them in there . \\nit also helps that as usual , allen has a top-flight cast working with him . \\ntheir singing voices range from quite good ( goldie hawn ) to not quite good ( allen ) to literally unlistenable ( barrymore , whose real voice was dubbed by a professional ) . \\nbut while their vocal abilities differ , all the actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen , and making it rub off on the audience . \\ngranted , some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies , but for those attuned to it , this film should work wonders . \\njane campion , too , has a top-flight cast working for her in \" portrait of a lady , \" too , but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted , virtually lifeless mess , albeit a visually interesting one . \\ncampion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety of eye-filling images that linger in the mind . \\nunfortunately , what didn\\'t linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting . \\ni remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman , but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people . \\neven worse , i don\\'t find myself feeling bad that i\\'ve forgotten . \\nthe problem , i think , lies not with the cast , which seemed to be trying very hard for the material . \\nit was the script that couldn\\'t convince me to care about anyone . \\nthe characters were putting out all kinds of emotion , but i found no reason to connect with any of them . \\ni understood that the story was about cold , emotionally vacant characters , but for me to care about them , i have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives . \\njones\\' script never simply gave me that opportunity . \\nin the end , it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes . \\nunfortunately , as she kept painting these dazzling pictures , they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film . \\nin the end , the movie\\'s one strength ended up hurting it . \\nso here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots , and yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them . \\nwhy ? \\nwith both films , my head cared about neither story , but only \" everyone says i love you \" was able to make my heart sing .', 'synopsis : an aging master art thief , his supplier , and a young , buxom security consultant are all not who they first appear to be ( or are they ? ) in this convoluted mess involving a risky heist during the millennium . \\ncomments : this movie was boring . \\nplain and simple . \\nentrapment should not have been boring . \\nit stars sean connery , who can still carry an action film despite his age , catherine zeta-jones , a likeable enough film presence , and ving rhames , ultra-cool star of pulp fiction and mission : impossible . \\nit takes full advantage of the y2k computer bug fears ( a current \" hot topic \" in the news ) in its storyline , which is set at the end of 1999 . \\nit has some genuinely well-staged action sequences . \\nso , what went wrong ? \\nplenty , unfortunately . \\nthe major problem with entrapment is its script . \\nit has a been-there , done-that feel to it . \\nnothing seems particularly inventive or original , so the whole movie lacks suspense and drags ( it runs nearly two hours ) . \\nthe screenwriters , for example , periodically use a countdown to the millennium as a means of transition between scenes ( i . e . \\n \" 4 days to the millennium \" ) . \\nthis device was used much more effectively in the overlooked sci-fi film strange days . \\nthe characters are not who they appear to be at the beginning , which is neat at first but the device wears thin once the umpteenth \" surprise \" revelation is made . \\nentrapment , in other words , relies too heavily on the audience not knowing what each character\\'s true motive is , resulting in a convoluted story which leaves many scratching their heads in confusion . \\nthe star power here is quite strong , but the viewer can\\'t help but feel the actors are wasted in this production . \\nsean connery is given such mind-numbing lines as \" never trust a naked woman . \" \\nving rhames\\' character seems like an afterthought ; he\\'s not developed at all . \\nthe camera zooms in frequently and leeringly at catherine zeta-jones\\'s tight wardrobe . \\nthis , in and of itself , is not bad , but , after a while , it has a juvenile feel to it . \\nat least the species movies hold no bones about the fact that they\\'re exploiting the female body . \\nentrapment does the same under the thin disguise of plot development ( sean connery supposedly falls in love with the girl while watching her , in tights , arc and pivot around laser beams ) . \\nthe tagline for this movie reads \" the trap is set . \" \\nit sure is , on those who spent money to see this movie . \\nentrapment really isn\\'t that bad ; it is watchable . \\ni would suggest , however , one waits until this is on cable or television to see it .', 'there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors . \\nwhen i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture . \\nyou see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries . \\ni hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories . \\ni hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac\\'s shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey . \\nthe badness of patch adams is stupefying . \\nit\\'s confounding . \\ni can\\'t believe a film can be this bad . \\nand yet , it\\'s based on a real man who probably has a good point to make . \\nin the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human . \\nin the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn\\'t want to kill himself . \\nwhile there , he notices that the doctors don\\'t care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings . \\nso , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients . \\nhe goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it\\'s good to help people . \\nhe also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti-male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor . \\nnaturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams . \\nso patch decides that he\\'s going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have . \\nand that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 . \\non a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn\\'t say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for ( i actually liked potter\\'s performance , even if she is wasted ) . \\nbut the film fails fundamentally in execution . \\nevery scene swells with grand , \" emotional \" music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard . \\ntake , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus . \\nwe don\\'t know patch yet , but there\\'s sad music , and it\\'s supposed to make us really sad that he\\'s sad . \\nlater on , patch makes a lot of progress : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively . \\nand when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) , the music is very very sad . \\nbut the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions . \\nreal drama is character-based . \\nyou grow to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it . \\nwe don\\'t ever grow to know the dying patient ; he\\'s simply a vehicle for patch\\'s greatness . \\nreal drama doesn\\'t seem forced , or present just to make the audience cry . \\nthat\\'s why patch adams is not real drama . \\nit goes for every cheap tear imaginable , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene . \\neven scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman\\'s sickening musical score . \\nsentimentality like this is indeed bad . \\nbut it\\'s not as bad as half-baked , simplistic themes . \\nyou see , patch is a really great student . \\nhe aces his tests without studying , and does it so effectively that people think he\\'s cheating . \\nbut patch doesn\\'t think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor . \\n \" why don\\'t we see patients until the third year ? \" he bursts out every three seconds . \\nwell , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients . \\nnot everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort . \\nmost of us have to study . \\nand a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn\\'t know a toe from a finger , probably won\\'t be too successful in preventing death . \\noh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to \" prevent death , \" but to \" improve the quality of life ! \" \\nyes ! \\nthat is true ! \\nand you can not do that without studying . \\nyou can not do that without going to medical school . \\nwhat patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later . \\nfollow the rules ? \\nbah ! \\nwho needs the rules ! \\nonly uptight doctors follow the rules . \\nthe real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants . \\nand then there\\'s the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic . \\na free clinic . \\nin the middle of the forest . \\nwhere patients can be taken to be helped . \\nfor free . \\nhow will patients be transported to the free clinic ? \\nwill it have an emergency room ? \\nor is it just for mental patients ? \\nand who , may i ask , will pay for it ? \\nthe film does give some token attempts to question patch\\'s motives ( i think another character asks him how he\\'s going to pay for it , in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance ) , but they certainly don\\'t explore or challenge patch\\'s ideas to any meaningful extent . \\nreader , please understand this : i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams . \\ni know nothing about him . \\nif his beliefs mirror those of this film character , then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them . \\nbut regardless of what the real patch adams believes , the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony . \\nand in the last scene , the big , obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus , patch does a lot of shouting . \\nactually , robin williams does a lot of shouting . \\nhe shouts a lot about helping people , and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words . \\ni won\\'t tell you that you can\\'t be moved by his words , because i , too , was moved by his words . \\ni was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be . \\npatch adams is the cheapest of them all .', 'i didn\\'t realize how apt the name of this movie was until i called the mpaa ( the motion picture association of america - the folks who decide what\\'s g , nc 17 , pg , r or x ) to ask why the preview was rated r . so that we can make some sense of their response , let me tell you about the movie itself . \\n \" the celluloid closet \" is a documentary about how homosexuality has been portrayed in the movies over the past several decades . \\nit\\'s brilliant , funny , naughty and extremely poignant . \\nit tore at my heart to watch a gifted lesbian screenwriter explain that , as a rule , gay audiences hunger for any hint of homosexuality on screen . \\nregardless of how veiled - or how sordid - the presence of a gay or lesbian person allows others to lessen their sense of isolation and makes them feel as if they\\'re not quite so invisible as america seems to want them to be . \\nthe movie itself is rated r - and for good reason . \\nit contains scenes of bloody , violent gay bashing and graphic , uninhibited , sex . \\nas with any movie , i appreciate knowing about these things ahead of time , so i can decide for myself whether to see the movie with a friend , a date , my 11 year old niece , alone or not at all . \\nbut , that\\'s the movie . \\nnow back to the preview . \\nprior to this film being theatrically released ( it was originally filmed as a documentary for hbo ) i had seen the coming attractions trailer for it at least six times . \\nthere was no nudity , no violence , no bad language , nothing that i could see that would be offensive or inappropriate for a general audience ( okay , whoopi goldberg did refer to someone \" boning \" someone , but the last i knew that wasn\\'t one of the seven words you can\\'t say on tv ) . \\nexcept for a scene of two fully clothed men kissing . \\nhmmmmm . \\nwhen i inquired about the rating on the trailer , a very nice woman at the mpaa quoted from \" the handbook \" that a trailer approved for all audiences could contain \" no homosexuality or lesbianism and no going down on someone . \" \\nhello ? i was in the office and it was the middle of the day . \\nbravely , i pursued . \\n \" i\\'ve seen that trailer , oh . . . \\nprobably half a dozen times , \" i gulped . . . \\n \" and i don\\'t remember that scene . \" \\n \" well , \" she chirped . \\n \" it\\'s there . \\nour little eyes are trained to see that . \" \\nno really . \\nin the words of dave barry , \" i am not making this up . \" \\nthey are \" trained \" to \" see that ? \" \\nwhen someone who was shocked at the rating the first time and made a note to watch it carefully the following five times or so managed to let it slip past her ? \\ngosh , i certainly don\\'t mean to question the mpaa , or \" the handbook \" . \\ni would , however , like to suggest that it\\'s they who are in the closet on this one . \\nand the light ain\\'t good in there . \\nbut , having seen \" the celluloid closet , \" and being one of a handful of straight people involved in a primarily gay and lesbian weekly bible study ( email me and i\\'ll give you the details ) , none of this was any big surprise . \\nthe point of the movie was that homosexuality , even in the politically correct 90s , is ridiculously perceived as a threat to a mostly heterosexual society . \\na point well made in this candid and honest film . \\nnow , i could go off on the mpaa\\'s ruling that a trailer must contain \" no homosexuality or lesbianism \" and ask how that is defined , particularly in light of some of the things , both sexual and non-sexual , that i\\'ve watched straight people do in trailers . \\ni just don\\'t feel the need to go there , because it seems so obvious . \\ni\\'ll instead suggest that the mpaa re-evaluated their evaluation criteria . \\nlet the ratings reflect not subject content , like \" sex \" and \" violence \" . \\nlet them reflect attitude content . \\nin the future , i\\'d be interested in knowing whether the movie is rated d for disrespectful or s for stereotyped . \\nthen i\\'d truly be able to make an informed decision about how i spent my time .', 'movies about teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be either interesting , entertaining or convincing , because of one fundamental reason : movies are made by adults and not teenagers . \\noccasionally , however , films like say anything , dazed and confused and the breakfast club will break the mold and offer genuine insight into the lives of those bizarre creatures which surround us called \" teenagers . \" \\ncan\\'t hardly wait , however , does not . \\ninstead , the writing/directing team of harry elfont and deborah kaplan manages to take every clich ? found in the teenage genre , strip it completely of perception , intelligence and wit - and turn it into one of the most nauseating cinematic experiences i have ever been subjected to . \\ncan\\'t hardly wait follows a group of characters as they attend a house party on the night of their

) , and brainy outsider denise ( lauren ambrose ) . \\ni couldn\\'t stand any of those characters . \\nwhether it was william getting drunk and signing along to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming \" yo , i gotta have sex tonight ! \" , \\nall i could think of was how elfont and kaplan possibly managed to con columbia pictures out of ten million dollars to fund their film . \\napparently , can\\'t hardly wait is supposed to be a comedy , but it tends to fail in this respect because of the fact that it\\'s not funny . \\nin all honesty , elfont and kaplan should be forced by their employers to attend remedial classes in humour . \\nand when i say \" forced \" , i mean it . \\nthey should be strapped down to a chair and have their eyes wedged open in a similar fashion to alex in a clockwork orange . \\nthis is how desperately they need to be educated about the concept of humour . \\nfor instance , can\\'t hardly wait features a foreign exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as \" i am a sex machine . \" \\nfor some reason , elfont and kaplan believe that if this character repeats it enough , eventually it will be funny . \\nif only elfont

short dealt with welle\\'s attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft . \\nwhile several clips of the film are seen , the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle\\'s attempts to film it , despite studio problems , a staggering workload , and extremely ill fortune on the set . \\nimpressive photography , but really only interesting to film historians . \\nsadie thompson ( u . s . a . , 1928 ) director : raoul walsh screenwriter : raoul walsh , from the john colton play \"

capra\\'s lost horizon , where several scenes had been restored using stills , i was interested to see sadie thompson , where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago . \\nthis is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story \" miss thompson \" . \\nthis is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen--little awkwardness , and a very clever script . \\nthe actors : gloria swanson , raoul walsh ( who also directed and wrote the screenplay ) and especially lionel barrymore , as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie\\'s soul , but really wants to get her between the sheets , is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel . \\nswanson adds real life to the character , adding an worldly , affectionate air to the bawdy sadie . \\nunfortunately , the ending is rather poorly tied up ; it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live-action film , or the original script . \\nthe happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on ( i cannot believe maugham\\'s short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia ) ; the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we\\'ve been waiting an hour and a half for . \\nstill , it\\'s entertaining right up to the end ; certainly barrymore\\'s incredibly hammy performance ( which , nonetheless , works , perhaps due to the silent screen ) is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells , bakkers , and robertses of the religious worlds . \\na c movie ; worth 2 . 50 if you can find it . \\nthe pied piper ( czechoslovakia ,

be dissected as a whole is writer/director neil labute\\'s basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story . \\nfirstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras . \\neverything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full-circle back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative . \\nbut to just state this is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult . \\nlabute\\'s ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what\\'s specifically impressive is the fact the characters\\' names are never revealed until the end credits roll . \\nfor the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic . \\nanother interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus . \\nwe\\'re always able to tell where the characters are ( someone\\'s home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc . ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like , etc . is relatively unknown . \\nthe film is a complete character study with the tight , intense drama of the theater . \\nno one plot dominates the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background . \\nwe\\'re simply dropped in on the characters\\' lives and are expected to figure out the rest . \\nthe characters are a group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they\\'re only concern right now seems to be their sex lives . \\nfirst there\\'s barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don\\'t know what they\\'re problem is . \\nbarry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but doesn\\'t have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else . \\nmary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , doesn\\'t hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something . \\nlabute\\'s script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two . \\nobviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors\\' good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit hollow . \\nanother couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything . \\ntheir sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship . \\nif only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area . \\nit\\'s natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ? \\nwhat did they ever see in the other person to begin with ? \\nlabute never really answers , but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process , it still makes for good drama , tension , and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it\\'s fascinating . \\ntwo other characters act as catalysts , cary ( jason patric ) and cheri ( natassja kinski ) . \\ncary is an arrogant , hostile sex-maniac who defines the word \" bastard . \" \\nsomehow he is able to bend women to his will , either through charm or just attitude , into getting his way . \\nhe\\'s the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he\\'s secretly perverted , but somehow barry finds comfort in his company , although jerry is always nervous around him . \\npatric gives an outstanding performance , so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is . \\ncheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her . \\nshe works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film , each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different , from becoming involved in a relationship with one , to brushing it off as small talk with another , to being outright appalled by yet another . \\nshe\\'s a sweet woman , perhaps the most normal of any of the characters , and although her symbolism is obvious , her role as the outsider is the most relatable . \\ni will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others\\' action , as that\\'s the hook of the film . \\nthe first two acts begin to set up the characters and each\\'s scenarios , but it\\'s often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom . \\nthe result is sometimes surprising , other times predictable , but the actual course of actions is always fascinating . \\nfor a while everyone has their fun , but ultimately each character\\'s guilt , attitude , or ignorance will disserve them . \\none of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be . \\nsince the characters only interact with each other there isn\\'t much pop culture references , as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it . \\nare we to assume that these people are , as the title states , our friends and neighbors ? \\ni don\\'t know of anyone going through the same situations as these people . \\noften times the film is not unlike a network melodrama , other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie . \\nbut what this film does have that the others don\\'t is repercussions in the end . \\nalthough the film creates its own reality , it goes to show that even the immoral aren\\'t immortal . \\nin what way \" your friends and neighbors \" is supposed to work is open to interpretation . \\nit definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity , but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically . \\nstill , it\\'s an accomplishment in film-making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective .', \"vampire's is a rude , chauvinistic movie where women are portrayed as pawns of abuse , present only to pleasure men , feed vampires , readied to be bashed or beaten - till one's sensibilities is shocked by the low iq and mentality of this regressive movie . \\nto make matters worse , the buffoons that go hunting vampires are all rednecks , and deserve to have their heads bitten off , if not , their bodies carved in half . \\nthe dilemma of hating the ? heroes' as much as the ? villains' , makes one wish that the ? hand of god' would suddenly appear and blast both parties into oblivion . \\njames wood portrays jack crow , a man obsessed with killing vampires , whose soul reason for living is based on revenge ( they killed his parents ) , but this is not a good excuse for being more obnoxious than the vampires . \\nas for adam baldwin , he is nothing more than a stooge who is ordered to beat women when the director shouts ? action' , and the script should have been reworked to avoid much offence against the female sex . \\nas for the claims that the catholic church created ? dracula' , well that is the second most sacrilegious suggestion , outside the fact that priests and monks bear the brunt of the vampire fury , with enough blood spilt to make the inquisition look tame . \\nan awful movie on all counts , my suggestion is to bring back buffy and bury this group of incompetent , rude vampire slayers .\", 'seen february 15 , 1998 on home video ( borrowed from chris wessell ) . \\nwhen it comes to modern gangster movies , it\\'s really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and/or just using the word \" routine . \" \\ni\\'ve always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it\\'s been used before ) can provide for a good story and \" donnie brasco \" clinches this idea . \\nit\\'s not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another\\'s style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale . \\nthe film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it . \\nwe meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk . \\nhe and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this . \\nsomehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn\\'t afraid of lefty and his rep , and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him . \\nit\\'s clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately , telling him all the tricks of the trade . \\ni have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit . \\nhowever , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer . \\nthe first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to . \\nthe screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original . \\nmost gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable . \\nthankfully the film doesn\\'t become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development . \\nmuch of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie . \\npacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would . \\nhe\\'s old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be . \\nwe learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it\\'s easy to sympathize with him . \\nnewell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run . \\nas donnie is constantly impressing and even one-upping lefty , it\\'s hard to tell which emotion is more powerful : the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob ; or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed . \\nmost of the film tells the story of donnie\\'s life in mafia , which creates for many sub-plots and individual conflicts , but doesn\\'t always seem to come together as a whole . \\nthe storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout , even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar . \\nthe resonance to donnie\\'s actual assignment varies , he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress , but it doesn\\'t always seem to have much meaning . \\nback home , his wife maggie ( heche ) is ready to divorce him because he\\'s never a and the family is suffering . \\nsince this is based on a true story i wouldn\\'t doubt this would happen , although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic . \\nmy only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure . \\na climax of sorts does occur , but there\\'s little feeling of a payoff . \\nwe get a happy ending , which is good , but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful . \\naside from a few minor , general flaws , \" donnie brasco \" manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development . \\nit may be routine , but it\\'s good , and that\\'s respectful .', 'the premise of this movie is , well , pretty far-fetched . \\ntom berenger plays shale , a mercenary who is temporarily out of work ( those fools at the cia have denied his existence just because he and his buddies botched a job in cuba ) . \\nfortunately , his girl friend ( diane venora ) , a teacher at christopher columbus high school in miami , gets her knee cap broken by a disgruntled student , creating a job opening for shale as a substitute teacher . \\nnot telling his girl friend , who might object on pedagogical grounds , he creates a number of fake higher degrees for himself ( from yale , harvard , princeton , et al ) and begins his tenure as a high school teacher . \\nthe students ( junkies , drug dealers , gang members , sleazy sluts , ice-pick wielders . . . you \\nget the picture ) don\\'t really take to him right away , so he hits one in the face with a can and breaks a few fingers . \\nthis gets their attention to a certain extent , so he tells them the story of the vietnam war : \" see , some homeboys from the north tried to muscle in on the turf of the homeboys from the south . \" \\noh yeah , now they can dig it ; the problem is just that nobody ever explained it properly before . \\nbut wait ! \\nthere are drugs being dealt in the school itself ! \\nand behind the whole scheme , in cahoots with the head gang , the kod ( no , not \" cod \" , but \" knights of destruction \" . . . really ! ) , is none other than . . . the \\nupright , ex-cop principal , played by the forgotten ghostbuster , ernie hudson ! \\nso shale does what any good teacher would do . \\nhe gets his buddies together , they gather together a bunch of bazookas and other major weapons , explosives , and cool stuff like that , and they have a big showdown against the drug dealers and kod at the high school . \\nok , so the premise is not just far-fetched , it\\'s downright dumb . \\nif this were a hong kong action comedy , we might just accept it , but it takes itself far too seriously to be truly fun . \\noh , it has its moments ; how one can truly hate a movie in which huge ( really huge ) amounts of cocaine are delivered in school busses ? \\nand to be fair , it is almost never really boring , as the action is interrupted by only short sequences of actual story . \\nbut over all , this is pretty much a made-for-tv movie with more ( and bigger ) explosions and more foul language . \\nin fact , it reminded me of \" miami vice \" without the production values , babes in skimpy bikinis , and pastels . \\nif you can sneak into the theater without paying , go for it . \\notherwise , wait for video . \\nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \\n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \\n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \\n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \\n * * * * * perfection . \\nsee it twice .', \"okay , okay . \\nmaybe i wasn't in the mood to watch a mindless action movie ; i am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii , even while admitting that it wasn't as good as the others . \\nhowewer , the latest segal picture didn't look that bad , and since none of my friends would go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them , i went to see it expecting a mild die hard rehash . \\nboy , was i wrong ! \\nin the first half of the movie , we are already assaulted with segal's acting , ( he is not simply wooden ; he is like a wall ) , gratuitous violence , an incredible plot , sexist and even more gratuitous nudity , and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes . \\nby the end , it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers . \\nnot once in the movie did segal appear worried or undecided , which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense . \\nof course , in movies like these , there must be a sidekick , and a love interest . \\nin these one we are given a two for one package in the form of a playboy model ( in the movie ) , which only functions as a supposed comic relief ( by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines ) , and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie . \\noh , of course , she appears naked from the waist up , and , of course , segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship ; they did not even seem to be interested in each other . \\ni have never seen so little chemistry between two people in a movie . \\noften , the villain saves the movie ; unfortunately , the villains here are cartoonish , stupid and unfunny , unmenacing . \\nhow many movies have psycho ex-special forces bad guys ? \\ntoo many . \\ni was able to predict the action all throughout the movie , including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death , the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceeds to explain his plan to him , the scene where we are shown the hero's superiors are stupid , the scene where the bad guy loses his gun and has to fight the hero hand to hand , etc . . . \\nsimply said , this is movie-making by the numbers , boring , and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the audience . \\nmy recommendation : if you go see it , bring a watch . \\nyou'll be looking at it for most of the movie . \\nmy . \\nrent die hard . \\nread a book . \\nstare at the sky . \\ndo not waste your time on this worthless piece of celluloid . \\nthe real sad thing is that there are a lot of movies out that i would rather have seen ; once again , dragged in by my friends , which by the way , liked the movie halfheartedly . \\nthey probably like wrestling too : - ) .\", \"this is the worst movie i've viewed so far in 98 . \\nthe avengers = silly = man dressed in a bowler hat + woman wearing tight leathers > evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits + greater evil , sir august de wynter wearing

production got a little too smug , the script a little to smart and direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided together to form a movie . \\nmy greatest criticism rests on the fact that there was no chemistry between emma peel and john steed ( thurman and fiennes ) ? something that was a vital element of the 60's tv serial of the same name . \\nthe dialogue goes on and on about tea and other finer british perks , but does not allow much room for character development and interaction , except to perhaps grate on the viewer's nerves . \\none wonders why the dynamic

michael redman \\none of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movie theater is when a cast of fine actors end up in a film that wastes their talents . \\nyou keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered . \\npsychologist norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) is called to the middle of the pacific ocean to work with the survivors of a plane crash . \\nwhen he arrives at the site , he discovers that there is no plane , but rather an enormous spacecraft that has been sitting 1 , 000 feet below the surface for almost 300 years . \\nhaving written a paper for the bush administration on how to handle first contact , he is chosen to head up the team of scientists investigating the ship . \\nhis group as outlined in his report , consists of beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist ; harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , a mathematician ; and ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist . \\nunfortunately it turns out that the writing was a blow-off project for goodman who did it for the money and named his then-colleagues to the team . \\n \" after all , \" he explains , \" who reads government documents ? \" \\nlead by

\\ni am happy \" flashes across the screen . \\nthis is unsettling for the psychologist . \\n \" what happens if jerry gets mad ? \" he asks . \\nbarnes is more pragmatic : he needs a last name because he can\\'t put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry . \\nthen the situation turns bad . \\ndeadly beasts appear from nowhere . \\na gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel . \\nlethal sea snakes attack goodman . \\na giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading \" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea \" . \\nthe suspicious scientists turn against

to care about his product . \\ndirector barry levinson has churned out a mish-mosh that doesn\\'t engage the audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes . \\nthe first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification . \\nit\\'s much like speed-reading a novel and realizing that you missed the nuances . \\nit doesn\\'t get any better when the action scenes begin . \\nwhile the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles , the people are still flat . \\noddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them . \\nafter adams experiences the interior of the sphere , no one bothers to ask him what happened . \\ntheir history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited . \\neven goodman and
